        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>
            The App uses Google AdMob to serve ads. AdMob may collect and use certain information as described in its own <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. We do not collect or store any personal information directly.
        </p>
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The App may use third-party services (such as AdMob) that collect information used to identify you. Please refer to their privacy policies for more details.
        </p>
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
